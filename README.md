Metacone
Metacone is a 3rd generation Artificial Intelligence project. Today’s AI algorithms are relying on a high number of labelled training datasets. However, Metacone’s algorithm focuses on personal interaction, similar to how new-born babies learn.

Users will start with having a virtual baby, which is an NFT. It learns from owners themselves and later on transforms to a private personal assistant but it won't remain only as an app on your phone. It will be possible to use the Metacone Baby as a professional AI assistant later when it grows up, depending on how and in which domain the owner trains it.

Each Metacone Baby will be born (or be minted) with some innate cognitive skills such as Reasoning, Abstract Thinking, EQ, Aesthetics and Creativity. These skills are forged into the DNA of the NFT randomly at the moment it is minted. They cannot be changed radically but can be improved to some extent with experience and acquired items. Each NFT will have a different learning speed according to their cognitive skills and the topic they are learning. A good match will mean learning faster. A bad match will also work but it means the user should put more time to teach the Metacone Baby. Moreover, each Metacone Baby will come with a unique 3D hyper realistic human face. The goal is that every user can have a great realistic experience while talking to their assistant and feel some attachment.

Metacone introduces the “Teach-and-Earn” model to the world. T&E works in two ways: at the early stages of the project users will earn $MTCN token every day, while interacting with their Metacone Baby on their smartphone and teaching whatever they want to teach. Later on it will be possible to let one NFT train another faster and easier, while the owners of Teacher NFTs will earn $MTCN paid by their students.

We chose the Solana ecosystem to issue our project, because transactions are very fast and low-cost. More importantly, there is an incredibly strong NFT community culture in Solana, and we have been in these communities since the very beginning.

Version Beta1 : We are a strong team that develops AI algorithms. (Metacone Algorithm is used for this demo) We will participate in the competition of the Solana hackhaton with our mobile application. 

In this way, you will have a special assistant who knows you better with your special data, as well as faster access to your special needs.

 Our app connects to a Phantom device in the beginning. Phantom uses custom Nfts in your wallet. These NFTs give you personal 3D character. In addition, certain abilities of the character such as IQ and Creativity are coded with the incoming data of these nfts.  Their answers vary according to these abilities.

 In the future, you will be able to get to know this character personally and introduce them your friends, and it will be updated accordingly.
